# .gitignore Usage and Examples

## How .gitignore Works

- Place a file named `.gitignore` in the root (or any subdirectory) of your repository.
- List file patterns—one per line—of files or directories you want Git to ignore.
- Lines starting with `#` are comments.
- Wildcards (`*`) and other glob patterns are supported.

## Example .gitignore File

```gitignore
# Ignore all .log files
*.log


SUBMISSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md

# Ignore a specific file
secret.txt

# Ignore all .env files in any folder
*.env

# Ignore OS-specific files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Ignore node_modules directory (common in Node.js projects)
node_modules/

# Ignore everything in the temp folder except keepme.txt
temp/*
!temp/keepme.txt
```

## Notes

- If you already committed a file, adding it to `.gitignore` won’t remove it from history. You must remove it with `git rm --cached <file>`.
- You can have multiple `.gitignore` files in subdirectories for finer control.
