/*

Summary
Purpose:
This code defines a "Smarter Agent" for the PlanetWars game, which is an AI player designed to make more strategic decisions than a purely random agent.

Main Logic:

Source Selection: The agent picks the strongest planet it owns (with the most ships) as the source for an attack.

Target Selection: It targets the weakest planet not owned by the agent (with the fewest ships).

Action: The agent sends half the ships from the strongest source planet to the weakest target planet.

Fallback Logic: If there are no available source or target planets, it defaults to sending half the ships from a fallback planet or doing nothing.

Algorithm Used
Algorithm Type:
Heuristic-based (not a classic algorithm like A, Dijkstra, or Genetic Algorithm)*

Heuristic: "Strongest-to-weakest" strategy.

Selects the strongest owned planet as the source.

Selects the weakest enemy planet as the target.

Sends half the source's ships to the target.

Key Features:

Determines the best available move based on ship count.

Does not use randomness for decision-making.

Uses a simple, rule-based strategy (not learning or optimization-based).

Bullet Points for Slides
Agent Type: Smarter (heuristic-based) agent for PlanetWars

Source Selection: Strongest owned planet (most ships)

Target Selection: Weakest enemy planet (least ships)

Action: Sends half of source’s ships to target

Fallback: Handles edge cases with simple fallback logic

Algorithm: Heuristic ("strongest-to-weakest"), not classic search or learning algorithm

In short:
This agent uses a simple, deterministic heuristic to select the strongest owned planet as a source and the weakest enemy planet as a target, sending half the source’s ships in each move, with basic fallback logic for edge cases.
